Transformers provides the following tasks out of the box:

Sentiment analysis: is a text positive or negative? Text generation (in English): provide a prompt and the model will generate what follows. 
Name entity recognition (NER): in an input sentence, label each word with the entity it represents (person, place, etc.)
Question answering: provide the model with some context and a question, extract the answer from the context. 
Filling masked text: given a text with masked words (e.g., replaced by [MASK]), fill the blanks.
Summarization: generate a summary of a long text. 
Translation: translate a text in another language.
Feature extraction: return a tensor representation of the text. Let's see how this work for sentiment analysis
